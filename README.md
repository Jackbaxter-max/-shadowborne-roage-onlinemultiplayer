Rougelike topdown 4 player 

ShadowBorne

gimmic:

when players die, their friends can consume their soul. the living player can then on command split into two halves
for the players to control. when consuming the soul, the player gets both classes, but have to manage both inventories and SP bars
at the same time, as well as having the power of both classes greatly reduced. when splitting into 2, both players HP and SP are halved, but
the power of their classes are at their maximum.

When Bosses are killed, players can either consume or trap. If consumed, the player who consumed gains a special passive ability E.G. Flame trail when dash, 
Close range teleportation. When souls are trapped, players can exchange them for items to help out in the climb.
